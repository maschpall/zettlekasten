(youtube video from Mischa van den Burg: How I Write & Publish Using Neovim & Hugo from the command line)
- Create a github $REPO where you store your markdown files
- edit a hugo config file in order to select a theme and the directory

to make it easey, write yourself a little script that prompts a line where it asks you to enter a filename and then creates a markdown file in the blog $REPO, with already a template including the frontmatter (title, date, tags) and links (YYYY-DD-MM-HHMM)

Extra:
- write also a script to reset the static web in a local server so you double check before posting
- write another script to publish this
